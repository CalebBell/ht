Support for numpy arrays (ht.vectorized)
========================================


Basic module which wraps all ht functions with numpy's vectorize.
All other object - dicts, classes, etc - are not wrapped. Supports star 
imports; so the same objects exported when importing from the main library
will be imported from here. 

>>> from ht.vectorized import *

Inputs do not need to be numpy arrays; they can be any interable:

>>> import ht.vectorized
>>> ht.vectorized.LMTD([100, 101], 60., 30., 40.2)
array([ 43.20040929,  43.60182765])

Note that because this needs to import ht itself, ht.vectorized
needs to be imported separately; the following will cause an error:
    
>>> import ht
>>> ht.vectorized # Won't work, has not been imported yet

The correct syntax is as follows:

>>> import ht.vectorized # Necessary
>>> from ht.vectorized import * # May be used without first importing ht
