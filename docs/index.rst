Introduction
------------

ht is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical or mechanical engineering. It includes modules
for various heat transfer functions.

Among the tasks this library can be used for are:

* Sizing a Shell & Tube heat exchanger using any of the Zukauskas, ESDU 73031, or Bell methods
* Calculating pressure drop in a Hairpin heat exchanger
* Calculating heat loss of objects, including insulated objects
* Calculating heat loss from buried pipe
* Performing radiative heat transfer calculations
* Conderser and Reboiler rating
* Detailed heat exchanger evaluation; finding fouling factors
* Heat transfer in packed beds
* Sizing a Plate and Frame heat exchanger
* Modeling an Air Cooler
* Supercritical CO2 or water heat transfer
