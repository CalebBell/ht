What is ht?
---------------

ht is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical or mechanical engineering. It includes modules
for various heat transfer functions.

The ht library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality. ht runs on
all operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is free
of charge. ht is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to perform some heat transfer calculations, give
ht a try.
