long_description = '''ht is open-source software for engineers and
technicians working in the fields of chemical or mechanical engineering. It
includes modules for various heat transfer functions. ht runs on all
operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is free of
charge. ht is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to perform some heat transfer calculations,
give ht a try.'''
