    r'''Calculates Nusselt number for single-phase flow in a
    **well-designed** Chevron-style plate heat exchanger according to [1]_.
    The data is believed to have been developed by APV International Limited,
    since acquired by SPX Corporation. This uses a curve fit of that data
    published in [2]_.

    .. math::
        Nu = C_1 Re^m Pr^{0.33}\left(\frac{\mu}{\mu_{wall}}\right)^{0.17}

    `C1` and `m` are coefficients looked up in a table, with varying ranges
    of Re validity and chevron angle validity. See the source for their
    exact values. The wall fluid property correction is included only if the
    viscosity values are provided.

        [-]
    Pr : float
        Prandtl number calculated with bulk fluid properties, [-]
    chevron_angle : float
        Angle of the plate corrugations with respect to the vertical axis
        (the direction of flow if the plates were straight), between 0 and
        90. Many plate exchangers use two alternating patterns; use their
        average angle for that situation [degrees]
    mu : float, optional
        Viscosity of the fluid at the bulk (inlet and outlet average)
        temperature, [Pa*s]

    Notes
    -----
    Data on graph from Re=0.1 to Re=10000, with chevron angles 30 to 65 degrees.
    See `PlateExchanger` for further clarification on the definitions.

    It is believed the constants used in this correlation were curve-fit to
    the actual graph in [1]_ by the author of [2]_ as there is no

    As the coefficients change, there are numerous small discontinuities,
    although the data on the graphs is continuous with sharp transitions
    of the slope.

    The author of [1]_ states clearly this correlation is "applicable only to
    well designed Chevron PHEs".

def Nu_plate_Martin(Re, Pr, plate_enlargement_factor, variant='1999'):
    r'''Calculates Nusselt number for single-phase flow in a
    Chevron-style plate heat exchanger according to [1]_, also shown in [2]_
    and [3]_.

    .. math::
        Nu = 0.122 Pr^{1/3} \left[f_d Re^2 \sin (2\phi)\right]^{0.374}

    The Darcy friction factor should be calculated with the Martin (1999)
    friction factor correlation, as that is what the power of 0.374 was
    regressed with. It can be altered to a later formulation by Martin in the
    VDI Heat Atlas 2E, which increases the calculated heat transfer friction
    slightly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Re : float
        Reynolds number with respect to the hydraulic diameter of the channels,

    variant : str

        factor correlations, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    Nu : float
        Nusselt number with respect to `Dh`, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Based on experimental data from Re from 200 - 10000 and enhancement
    factors calculated with chevron angles of 0 to 80 degrees. See
    `PlateExchanger` for further clarification on the definitions.

    Note there is a discontinuity at Re = 2000 for the transition from
    laminar to turbulent flow, arising from the friction factor correlation's
    transition ONLY, although the literature suggests the transition
    is actually smooth.

    A viscosity correction power for liquid flows of (1/6) is suggested, and
    for gases, no correction factor.

    Notes
    -----
    The correlation as presented in [1]_ suffers from a typo, with a
    coefficient of 10.51 instead of 10.15. Several more decimal places were
    published along with the corrected typo in [2]_. This has a *very large*
    difference if not implemented.

    The viscosity correction power is recommended to be the blanket
    Sieder and Tate (1936) value of 0.14.

    The correlation is recommended in the range of Reynolds numbers above
    1000, chevron angles between 30 and 60 degrees, and enlargement factors
    from 1 to 1.5. Due to its cubic nature it is not likely to give good
    results if the chevron angle or enlargement factors are out of those
    ranges.
