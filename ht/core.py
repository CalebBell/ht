def LMTD(Thi, Tho, Tci, Tco, counterflow=True):
    r'''Returns the log-mean temperature difference of an ideal counterflow
    or co-current heat exchanger.

    .. math::
        \Delta T_{LMTD}=\frac{\Delta T_1-\Delta T_2}{\ln(\Delta T_1/\Delta T_2)}

        \text{For countercurrent:      } \\
        \Delta T_1=T_{h,i}-T_{c,o}\\
        \Delta T_2=T_{h,o}-T_{c,i}

        \text{Parallel Flow Only:} \\
        {\Delta T_1=T_{h,i}-T_{c,i}}\\
        {\Delta T_2=T_{h,o}-T_{c,o}}

    Parameters
    ----------
    Thi : float
        Inlet temperature of hot fluid, [K]
    Tho : float
        Outlet temperature of hot fluid, [K]
    Tci : float
        Inlet temperature of cold fluid, [K]
    Tco : float
        Outlet temperature of cold fluid, [K]
    counterflow : bool, optional
        Whether the exchanger is counterflow or co-current

    Returns
    -------
    LMTD : float
        Log-mean temperature difference [K]

    Notes
    -----
    Any consistent set of units produces a consistent output.

    Examples
    --------
