def Ft_aircooler(Thi, Tho, Tci, Tco, Ntp=1, rows=1):
    r'''Calculates log-mean temperature difference correction factor for
    a crossflow heat exchanger, as in an Air Cooler. Method presented in [1]_,
    fit to other's nonexplicit work. Error is < 0.1%. Requires number of rows
    and tube passes as well as stream temperatures.

    .. math::
        F_T = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k}(1-r_{1,m})^k\sin(2i\arctan R)

    .. math::
        R = \frac{T_{hi} - T_{ho}}{T_{co}-T_{ci}}

    .. math::
        r_{1,m} = \frac{\Delta T_{lm}}{T_{hi} - T_{ci}}

    Parameters
    ----------
    Thi : float
        Temperature of hot fluid in [K]
    Tho : float
        Temperature of hot fluid out [K]
    Tci : float
        Temperature of cold fluid in [K]
    Tco : float
        Temperature of cold fluid out [K]
    Ntp : int
        Number of passes the tubeside fluid will flow through [-]
    rows : int
        Number of rows of tubes [-]

    Returns
    -------
    Ft : float
        Log-mean temperature difference correction factor [-]

    Notes
    -----
    This equation assumes that the hot fluid is tubeside, as in the case of air
    coolers. The model is not symmetric, so ensure to switch around the inputs
    if using this function for other purposes.

    This equation appears in [1]_. It has been verified.
    For some cases, approximations are made to match coefficients with the
    number of tube passes and rows provided.
    16 coefficients are used for each case; 8 cases are considered:

    * 1 row 1 pass
    * 2 rows 1 pass
    * 2 rows 2 passes
    * 3 rows 1 pass
    * 3 rows 3 passes
    * 4 rows 1 pass
    * 4 rows 2 passes
    * 4 rows 4 passes

    -----
    The tube-row count correction factor `F2` can be disabled by setting `tube_rows`
    to 10. The property correction factor `F1` can be disabled by not specifying
    `Pr_wall`. A Prandtl number exponent of 0.26 is recommended in [1]_ for
    heating and cooling for both liquids and gases.

    There is a third correction factor in [1]_ for tube angles not 30, 45, or
    60 degrees, but it is not fully explained and it is not shown in [2]_.
    Another correction factor is in [2]_ for flow at an angle; however it would
    not make sense to apply it to finned tube banks due to the blockage by the
    fins.

    The data used by the ESDU covered:

        * tube outer diameters 3/8 to 2 inches
        * fin heights 1/3 to 5/8 inches
        * fin tip to fin root diameters 1.2 to 2.4

    [1]_ claims 72% of experimental points were within 10% of the results of
    the correlation.

    The Reynolds number used in this equation is that based on `V_max`,
    calculated using the minimum flow area.

    Notes
    -----
    Low fins are fins which were formed on the tube outside wall, normally
    by the cold rolling process. The data used by the ESDU covered:
        * fin density 11 to 32/inch
        * tube outer diameters 0.5 to 1.25 inches
        * fin heights 0.03 to 0.1 inches
        * Reynolds numbers 1000 to 80000

    [1]_ compared this correlation with 81 results and obtained a standard
    deviation of 7.7%.

    The Reynolds number used in this equation is that based on `V_max`,
    calculated using the minimum flow area.
