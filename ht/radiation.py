def blackbody_spectral_radiance(T, wavelength):
    r'''Returns the spectral radiance, in units of W/m^3/sr.

    .. math::
        I_{\lambda,blackbody,e}(\lambda,T)=\frac{2hc_o^2}
        {\lambda^5[\exp(hc_o/\lambda k T)-1]}

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : float
        Temperature of the surface, [K]
    wavelength : float
        Length of the wave to be considered, [m]

    Returns
    -------
    I : float
        Spectral radiance [W/m^3/sr]

    Notes
    -----
    Can be used to derive the Stefan-Boltzman law, or determine the maximum
    radiant frequency for a given temperature.

    Examples
    --------

def q_rad(emissivity, T, T2=0):
    r'''Returns the radiant heat flux of a surface, optionally including
    assuming radiant heat transfer back to the suface.

    .. math::
        q = \epsilon \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)

    Parameters
    ----------
    emissivity : float
        Fraction of black-body radiation which is emmited, []
    T : float
        Temperature of the surface, [K]
    T2 : float, optional
        Temperature of the surrounding material of the surface [K]

    Returns
    -------
    q : float
        Heat exchange [W/m^2]

    Notes
    -----
    Emissivity must be less than 1. T2 may be larger than T.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> q_rad(1., 400)
    1451.613952

    >>> q_rad(.85, 400, 305.)
