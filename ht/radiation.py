def q_rad(emissivity, T, T2=0):
    r'''Returns the radiant heat flux of a surface, optionally including

    ----------
    emissivity : float
        Fraction of black-body radiation which is emitted, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    q : float
        Heat exchange [W/m^2]

    Notes
    -----
    Emissivity must be less than 1. T2 may be larger than T.

def grey_transmittance(extinction_coefficient, molar_density, length, base=e):
    r'''Calculates the transmittance of a grey body, given the extinction
    coefficient of the material, its molar density, and the path length of the
    radiation.

    .. math::
        \tau = base^{(-\epsilon \cdot l\cdot \rho_m )}

    Parameters
    ----------
    extinction_coefficient : float
        The extinction coefficient of the material the radiation is passing at
        the modeled frequency, [m^2/mol]
    molar_density : float
        The molar density of the material the radiation is passing through,
        [mol/m^3]
    length : float
        The length of the body the radiation is transmitted through, [m]
    base : float, optional
        The exponent used in calculations; `e` is more theoretically sound but
        10 is often used as a base by chemists, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    transmittance : float
        The fraction of spectral radiance which is transmitted through a grey
        body (can be liquid, gas, or even solid ex. in the case of glasses) [-]

    Notes
    -----
    For extinction coefficients, see the HITRAN database. They are temperature
    and pressure dependent for each chemical and phase.

    Examples
    --------
    Overall transmission loss through 1 cm of precipitable water equivalent
    atmospheric water vapor at a frequency of 1.3 um [2]_:

    >>> grey_transmittance(3.8e-4, molar_density=55300, length=1e-2)

def solar_spectrum(model='SOLAR-ISS'):
    r'''Returns the solar spectrum of the sun according to the specified model.
    Only the 'SOLAR-ISS' model is supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str, optional
        The model to use; 'SOLAR-ISS' is the only model available, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    wavelengths : ndarray
        The wavelengths of the solar spectra, [m]
    SSI : ndarray
        The solar spectral irradiance of the sun, [W/(m^2*m)]
    uncertainties : ndarray
        The estimated absolute uncertainty of the measured spectral irradiance
        of the sun, [W/(m^2*m)]

    Notes
    -----
    The power of the sun changes as the earth gets closer or further away.

    In [1]_, the UV and VIS data come from observations in 2008; the IR comes
    from measurements made from 2010-2016. There is a further 28 W/m^2 for the
    3 micrometer to 160 micrometer range, not included in this model. All data
    was corrected to a standard distance of one astronomical unit from the Sun,
    as is the resultant spectrum.

    The variation of the spectrum as a function of distance from the sun should
    alter only the absolute magnitudes.

    [2]_ contains another dataset.

    99.9% of the time this function takes is to read in the solar data from
    disk. This could be reduced by using pandas.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> wavelengths, SSI, uncertainties = solar_spectrum()

    Calculate the minimum and maximum values of the wavelengths (0.5 nm/3000nm)
    and SSI:

    >>> min(wavelengths), max(wavelengths), min(SSI), max(SSI)
    (5e-10, 2.9999000000000003e-06, 1330.0, 2256817820.0)

    Integration - calculate the solar constant, in untis of W/m^2 hitting
    earth's atmosphere.
